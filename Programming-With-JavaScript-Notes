# Programming With Java Script

## Notes on Reading 07

### HTML refresher 
- elements consist of open tag <p ,the content, and a close tag /p>
- opening tags can carry attributes (i.e. class) which tell us more about that element.
- Attributes have a name and value, usually given in quotation marks ""
- dicates the outline or core layout of your page. This is the skeleton of your webpage.

### CSS Refresher
- basically these are rules to indicate how elements display in the browser
- each rule has a selector. for exmaple ".fruit" selects the class defined as fruit in the orginal element.
- CSS dictates the the position, dimensions, and aesthetics (referred to as "styles") of your web page.
- This is the skin, hair, nails, eyes of your webpage.

### Javascript
- Java Script allows us to access content, modify content, set program rules to alter the content of page.
- encompasses many traditional rules of programming which make it a powerful, widely-applicaple programming language.
- makes web pages feel more interactive by responding to user input like passwords, clicking buttons, grand totals in shopping carts etc.

-Functions let you group a bunch of statements together to do something specific. 
The coolest part about them is they make code resuable which allows for more efficent use of time when coding!
The best devs are the ones that complete most effective programs or websites with concise code. High Output, Low ManHours.
-Objects group a set of variables and functions together to create a model of something more familiar in the real world.
-We used the hotel example in class: it had 5 properties and one method. The object is notated by the curly braces. The properties are just variables
created and defined within the curly braces. The method is basically a function with the object.
