# Notes on HTML and CSS

### Chapter 1

-HTML pages are basically crucial text docs that form the framework of a website or program.
-HTML uses characters that sit inside angled brackets <> called tags. They're used to ascribe special meaning to their target. Tags are also referred to as elements.
-Opening tags can carry attributes, which explain the content of that element.
-Attributes require a name and a value. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

### Chapter 17
-The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
-The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
-Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

### Chapter 8
-DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
-You can add comments to your code between the markers
-The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
-The <div> and elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
-cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
-The tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
-Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

### Chapter 18
-It’s important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
-Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page
-Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
-You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
-You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present

After we cloned our gits, we proceeded to experiment with these findings in VS Code. I worked with Gharret.
