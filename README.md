To me, the growth mindset achieved a person has finally reached a point in their life when they're tired of stagnating mediocrity and ready to do something about it.

A few things I focus on to stay in the growth mindset:
- Nothing is easy until it is finished, it's only the beginning and I will get through this.
- This skill is a hard skill to acquire, it's meant to be that way. We grow by challenging ourselves.
- "I can't figure this out..." and the answer is "...yet!"
