Born in Israel and began a long journey, moved to Canada, then the US in 2005. So by the age of 12, I had lived on two continents, in 5 cities, across 3 countries, atteneded 7 different schools and spoke 3 languages.

Today, I'm just a college drop-out, turned self-made business owner, aspiring to learn javascript and then join the ranks of the software wizards of today's world!

To me, the growth mindset achieved a person has finally reached a point in their life when they're tired of stagnating mediocrity and ready to do something about it.

### A few things I focus on to stay in the growth mindset:

- Nothing is easy until it is finished, it's only the beginning and I will get through this.
- This skill is a hard skill to acquire, it's meant to be that way. We grow by challenging ourselves.
- " ~~I can't figure this out!~~ " ***yet!***

### Fun Facts About Me

### Fun Quote
